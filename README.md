# SI579 Final Project: Weather Map App

This project is organized using the standard React + Vite file structure. Please find the code I worked on in the `src/` folder.

- `App.jsx`: The main application component
- `components/`: Custom React components used for this project
- `utils/`: `weatherIcons.js` contains a JavaScript object that serves as a lookup table mapping Open-Meteo weather codes to emoji icons
- `index.css` & `App.css`: CSS files for styling the application
